    <p>The Indian peninsula is home to many majestic and mighty mountain peaks and ranges. The most prominent among these are the Great Himalayas that boast almost all the high peaks in the world. The Mount Everest is the highest point, reaching an elevation of almost 8,848 m. Leh-Ladakh lying in the northern part of the Great Himalayas is a surreal tourist destination, where one can visit to admire natural retreats, soak in serenity and spirituality, and indulge in adventure sports like trekking, mountain biking, mountain climbing etc. Moreover, the meadows of Tapovan in Uttarakhand provide enchanting views of the peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas. To explore the Kumaon Himalayas, head to Munsiyari, a tiny hill town, which makes an excellent vantage point to sight the spectacular Panchachuli group of peaks</p>
