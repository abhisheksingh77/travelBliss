          <p>Chamba offers amazing opportunities for adventure enthusiasts, thanks to its mountainous landscape. Hiking has gained immense popularity among tourists visiting Chamba. For beginners, the Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary is a great option to indulge in hiking. Traversing the narrow winding paths lined with tall pines and deodars and witnessing the scenic beauty of the sanctuary is truly a fascinating experience. Private operators also organise mountain rappelling sessions in the Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of which includes hiking through a steep rocky terrain to reach the top of a cliff. Apart from the sanctuary, tourists can also trek through the enchanting U-shaped Chamba Valley and witness spectacular views of the Pir Panjal, Dhauladhar and Bera Bangahal Himalayan ranges. Expert hikers can take the Chamba-Sach Pass-Pangi Valley trek, which is much more challenging. It begins at Trela, 80 km from Chamba, and is one of the best treks in the region.</p>
