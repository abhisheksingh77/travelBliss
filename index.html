  <p> India is the land of myriad experiences and exotic locales. It is a world of resplendent
colors and rich cultural locales, magnificent monuments, heritage temples, or tombs
The country ancient cultural heritage is inextricably linked to its technology-driven
present existence. The co-existence of several religions and cultures, together with
an awe-inspiring topography, makes it the perfect place for a complete.
Tourism in India is the largest service industry, with a contribution of 6.23% to the
national GDP and 8.78% of the total employment in India. India witnesses more than
5.5 million annual foreign tourist arrivals and 740 million domestic tourism visits. The
tourism industry in India generated about 100 billion US$ in 2008, and that is
expected to increase to US$275.5 billion by 2018 at a 9.4% annual growth rate.</p> 
  
<p>Objects are a part of the study of human history because they provide a concrete basis for ideas, and can validate them. Their preservation demonstrates a recognition of the necessity of the past and of the things that tell its story.
 In The Past is a Foreign Country, David Lowenthal observes that preserved objects also validate memories. While digital acquisition techniques can provide a technological solution that is able to acquire the shape and the appearance of artifacts with an unprecedented precision
 in human history, the actuality of the object, as opposed to a reproduction, draws people in and gives them a literal way of touching the past. This unfortunately poses a danger as places and things are damaged by the hands of tourists,
 the light required to display them, and other risks of making an object known and available. The reality of this risk reinforces the fact that all artifacts are in a constant state of chemical transformation, so that what is considered to be preserved is actually changing 
 it is never as it once was. Similarly changing is the value each generation may place on the past and on the artifacts that link it to the past.
