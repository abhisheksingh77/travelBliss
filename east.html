    <p>Comprising seven states, known as the Seven Sisters, along with the inclusion of Sikkim, Northeast India is known for its interesting tribal cuisine and beverage culture, which hasn’t changed much since the medieval period. In fact, the Northeast not only has some interesting variations of vegetarian dishes from Manipur, but also a wide array of meat-based dishes made of pigeon, wild boar and pig meat. This region is rich in fermented food and unlike the rest of India, the cuisine here uses fermented pickles and mixes like akhuni (dish made of fermented soyabean) to get its flavours. It is considered as one of the healthiest cuisines in the world.</p>
