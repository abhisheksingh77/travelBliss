             <img src="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/423/223/714/photography-india-temple-sun-wallpaper-preview.jpg">
             <p>Located on the banks of River Godavari,
            Basar lies at a distance of 34 km from Nizamabad and about 208 km from the city of Hyderabad. A major attraction is the Gnana Saraswathi Temple that holds much significance in the hearts of the devotees.
          Dedicated to the holy trinity of Goddess Saraswathi, Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Kali, it is believed to have been the abode of sage Veda Vyasa, the author of the epic Mahabharata. Bijialudu, a Kannada king,
        is said to have built the temple. It is considered to be a holy place for children to perform “Akshara Abhyasam” a ceremony that marks the beginning of formal education. The puja starts at the temple at 4 am daily while Alankarana begins at 5 am.
       The festivals of Maha Shivratri and Devi Navarathrulu see heavy crowds.

          <h2>Golden Temple</h2>
          <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3168631.jpg">
        
          <p>Amritsar is world-famous for the beautiful and highly revered Golden Temple or Sri Harmandir Sahib, which is one of the most prominent spiritual sites in the country. The temple is a two-storeyed structure with its top half covered in almost 400 kg of pure gold leaf, which is what earned it its English moniker. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the leader of the Sikh empire, is believed to have initiated the construction in the 19th century. The rest of the temple complex is built in white marble, inlaid with precious and semi-precious colourful stones. To create motifs, the pietra dura technique has been used. The grand temple complex is awe-inspiring in its size.</p>
