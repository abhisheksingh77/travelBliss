         <p>Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that have made it one of the most sought after tourist destinations in Asia. A long shoreline with serene beaches, tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife, are just a few of the wonders. Most of the state is engulfed in rich greenery which ensures a very calming experience at all times. Bestowed with a pleasant and equable climate throughout the year, Kerala is a tropical land where one can relax and be at ease.</p>
         <P>Sprawled along the shores of the picturesque Vembanad Lake, the largest in Kerala, Kumarakom is noted for its tranquil backwaters. Cruising in houseboats along the lake while breathing in the splendid beauty of the surroundings and absorbing the local culture of the quaint hamlets lying on the fringes, is an unforgettable experience. Kumarakom is renowned for an epynomous bird sanctuary, which is a popular spot to catch sightings of endemic and migratory birds. Some not-to-be-missed avian breeds one can spot here are wood beetles, larks, flycatchers, parrots, teals, Siberian cranes, owls, water duck, and waterfowls. An intriguing way to visit the sanctuary is on a boat that offers a closer look at the birds flocking around the water body</P>
